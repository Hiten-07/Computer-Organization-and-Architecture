The CPU operates in a repetitive cycle:

1. Fetch
Instruction is fetched from memory using the Program Counter.

2. Decode
Control Unit interprets the instruction.

3. Execute
ALU performs the operation.

4. Store (Write-back)
Result is stored in a register or memory.

This is known as the Fetch–Decode–Execute Cycle.
