5.1 Single-Cycle CPU
Each instruction completes in one clock cycle.
Simple but inefficient for complex instructions.

5.2 Multi-Cycle CPU
Instructions are broken into steps across multiple cycles.
Better hardware utilization.

5.3 Pipelined CPU
Overlaps execution of multiple instructions.
Improves throughput (modern processors).
